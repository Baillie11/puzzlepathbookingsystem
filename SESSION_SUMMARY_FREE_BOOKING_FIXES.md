# PuzzlePath Booking System - Free Booking Fixes Session Summary

## Date: 2025-09-17 (06:00 - 06:33 UTC)

## INITIAL PROBLEM
User reported free booking system had 3 major issues:
1. **Credit card fields not disappearing** (only greyed out) when 100% discount applied
2. **No confirmation page** after free booking completion  
3. **No confirmation email** sent for free bookings

## ADDITIONAL CRITICAL ISSUES DISCOVERED
4. **Free booking notice showing on page load** before any coupon applied
5. **Entire booking form disappearing** when discount code applied (critical bug)

## WORK COMPLETED

### Issue #1: Credit Card Field Hiding
**Fixed in:** `js/booking-form.js`
- Enhanced CSS selectors to completely hide card elements
- Added multiple hiding methods: `#card-element`, `.card-container`, `.payment-section`, `$('[id*="card"]')`
- Used `parent().hide()` to catch wrapper elements

### Issue #2: Confirmation Page/Flow  
**Fixed in:** `js/stripe-payment.js`
- Replaced form hiding/showing with complete HTML replacement
- Added prominent styled confirmation message with booking code
- Automatic scroll to success message
- Direct link to quest app (app.puzzlepath.com.au)

### Issue #3: Email System
**Fixed in:** `puzzlepath-booking.php` 
- Added comprehensive email debugging for free bookings
- Enhanced logo path validation with placeholder fallback
- Always log email attempts and results
- Email sending confirmed working in backend (`line 1798: $this->send_confirmation_email()`)

### Issue #4: Premature Free Booking Notice
**Fixed in:** `js/booking-form.js`
- Completely rewrote detection logic
- Free booking notice only shows when: `eventSelected && actuallyFreeFromCoupon`
- Added explicit checks: `basePrice > 0 AND couponApplied = true AND finalTotal <= 0`
- Added console debugging to track logic flow

### Issue #5: Form Disappearing Bug (CRITICAL)
**Fixed in:** `js/stripe-payment.js`
- Removed old success handling logic that triggered on coupon application
- Free booking success now ONLY happens when user clicks "Complete Free Booking"
- Coupon application just updates UI but keeps form visible
