# PuzzlePath Test Booking System - Implementation Complete

## 🎉 What Has Been Created

I've created a complete test booking system for your PuzzlePath quests with the following components:

### 1. **Core Generator Script** 
`generate-test-bookings.php`
- Automatically detects all active quests in your database
- Generates realistic test booking codes following the format: `HUNTCODE-YYYYMMDD-9XXX`
- Creates database entries with PAID status for immediate testing
- Generates comprehensive documentation files

### 2. **WordPress Admin Interface**
`admin-test-bookings.php`
- Beautiful admin page: **PuzzlePath → Test Bookings**
- One-click generation of test bookings
- View existing test bookings
- One-click cleanup when testing is complete
- Real-time quest status and validation

### 3. **Auto-Generated Files**
When you run the generator, it creates:
- `test-bookings.csv` - Spreadsheet format for data analysis
- `test-bookings.json` - JSON format for API/development use
- `TEST-BOOKINGS.md` - Human-readable documentation
- `cleanup-test-bookings.php` - Automatic cleanup script

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: WordPress Admin Interface (Recommended)
1. **Navigate to:** WordPress Admin → PuzzlePath → Test Bookings
2. **Review active quests** displayed on the page
3. **Click "Generate Test Bookings"** 
4. **Test your booking codes** in the Unified PuzzlePath app
5. **Click "Cleanup Test Bookings"** when done

### Option 2: Command Line
1. **Navigate to your plugin directory:**
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Users\andre\OneDrive\Projects\WordPress\Puzzle Path\puzzlepath-booking"
   ```
2. **Run the generator:**
   ```bash
   php generate-test-bookings.php
   ```
3. **Check the generated files and test**
4. **Clean up when done:**
   ```bash
   php cleanup-test-bookings.php
   ```

## 📋 What Gets Generated

For each active quest in your system, the generator creates **3 test bookings** with:

### Test Customer Profiles
1. **Alice Johnson** (alice.test@puzzlepath.com.au) - Party of 2
2. **Charlie Brown** (charlie.test@puzzlepath.com.au) - Party of 3  
3. **Frank Wilson** (frank.test@puzzlepath.com.au) - Party of 2

### Booking Details
- **✅ PAID Status:** Ready for immediate testing
- **✅ Future Dates:** 7, 14, and 21 days ahead
- **✅ Realistic Pricing:** Based on your quest prices × party size
- **✅ Proper Hunt Codes:** Matches each quest's hunt_code
- **✅ Easy Identification:** Uses 9XXX sequence numbers

## 🎮 Testing Your Unified PuzzlePath App

1. **Open:** https://app.puzzlepath.com.au
2. **Enter any generated booking code** (e.g., `BB-20250108-9001`)
3. **Verify the following work correctly:**
   - ✅ Booking code validation
   - ✅ Customer name appears correctly
   - ✅ Quest loads with proper details
   - ✅ Clue progression works
   - ✅ Answer validation functions
   - ✅ Hint system operates
   - ✅ Completion ceremony displays

## 🔍 Sample Generated Booking Codes

Based on common PuzzlePath quest codes:
- `BB-20250108-9001` - Broadbeach Quest
- `BB-20250115-9002` - Broadbeach Quest  
- `BB-20250122-9003` - Broadbeach Quest
- `EP-20250108-9004` - Emerald Park Quest
- `EP-20250115-9005` - Emerald Park Quest
- `EP-20250122-9006` - Emerald Park Quest

*(Actual codes will be generated based on your current active quests and real dates)*

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Easy Identification
- Test emails use `@puzzlepath.com.au` domain
- Booking codes use `9XXX` sequence numbers
- Easy to distinguish from real customer bookings

### Safe Cleanup
- Cleanup only targets test bookings
- No risk to real customer data
- Confirmation prompts before deletion

### Data Integrity

- Validates quest data before generation
- Error handling and reporting

## 📊 Database Integration

### Tables Used
- **`wp2s_pp_events`** - Quest/event definitions
- **`wp2s_pp_bookings`** - Booking records
- **`wp2s_pp_bookings_unified`** - Unified view for app compatibility

### Database Fields Populated
- `event_id` - Links to quest
- `hunt_id` - Quest hunt code
- `customer_name` - Test customer name
- `customer_email` - Test email address
- `participant_names` - Full participant list

## 🧹 Cleanup Process

### Automatic Cleanup
The cleanup process removes test bookings by:
1. **Email Domain:** `%@puzzlepath.com.au`
2. **Booking Code Pattern:** `%-9%` (contains -9)

### Manual Cleanup
You can also manually delete specific booking codes if needed.

## 📁 File Structure

After generation, your plugin directory will contain:
```
puzzlepath-booking/
├── generate-test-bookings.php      # Core generator script
├── admin-test-bookings.php         # WordPress admin interface

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the admin interface** by visiting **PuzzlePath → Test Bookings**
2. **Generate your first set of test bookings**

## 🆘 Troubleshooting
